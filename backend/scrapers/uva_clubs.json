While we are led by systems engineering students, we are open to ALL majors, ALL years, and do NOT have an application process. How Does It Work? We network with different service organizations across Grounds to understand some of the problems that they face, then we take on those organizations as our clients for a semester (i.e., we have fall projects and spring projects). Interested BAPS members are split up into project teams, where they employ technical systems expertise to refine and improve the operations of their assigned client, to ultimately help them solve the problem they're facing. At the end of each semester, all the project teams present their solutions to their clients and the BAPS Executive Team. Former clients include Madison House, the Gordie Center, FoodAssist, SWAP UVA, the UVA Wheelchair Tennis Team, YellowRed, and Josie's Way. An example of a recent project conducted by one of our project teams was creating an automated tracking system for FoodAssist to help them see when their volunteers arrived and left their shifts throughout the week.Why Should You Join?Since we are a relatively new initiative (est. March 2024), we have a lot of open Exec Team positions. Also, you can add any projects that you participate in straight to your LinkedIn, resume, etc. Further, if you are interested in following the consulting track, BAPS is a great item to talk about in interviews, as we apply problem-solving skills to address real challenges for real clients. We have gotten feedback from previous members that BAPS was one of the main items their now employers were interested in on their consulting applications.Have Questions?Please visit our website bapsatuva.org for more details on our operations. If you know that you would like to join us or have immediate questions, please feel free to email us at bapscontact@virginia.edu.",

The journal is intended to curate an open conversation characterized by thoughtful cultural engagement. We seek to live out God’s abundant love for the world through exploration of our own lives and the life of the world itself. We hope to create in this journal a space both to reflect on the deeper holiness of life in the midst of a competitive, fast-paced student culture, and to explore our sense of vocation as students, to see where the world is calling to sow the seeds of reinvention and reexamination to bear the fruit of resurrection life. The university is a space for getting one’s bearings, and this journal intends to take seriously the beauty in the very process of understanding the past, questioning the present, pushing towards the future, and bearing with each other in love. We are a member of the Augustine Collective, a national independent network of Christian journals on college campuses, and will accept submissions from any U.Va. undergraduate or graduate students writing on matters of Christian faith and related questions. ",

Our work emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding, ideological diversity and solution-oriented politics. By engaging America’s youth in constructive discussions, we are equipping the next generation of leaders with the skills necessary for navigating conflict, finding solutions across differences and building bridges in their communities.BridgeUSA’s 50 college chapters bring together students from across the ideological spectrum for constructive dialogue on topics happening across the nation. These discussions are not meant to change one’s mind on a subject, but to encourage participants to seek an understanding of alternate viewpoints in effort for better political dialogue.",

    "description": "Common Cents (https://commoncents.org/) is a national nonprofit seeking to empower college students with the knowledge to manage their money and reach financial independence. We strive to make personal finance interactive, engaging, and appealing for a wide audience. Regardless of age, major, career, or income level, we seek to break the stigma and fear of personal finance and improve financial literacy. This organization was first launched at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and has expanded to other colleges such as Cornell, Johns Hopkins, and Florida State. After meeting with national leadership from UPenn, we were approved to start our own chapter at the University of Virginia. We now have an executive committee, approximately 30 members signed up, and Professor Dorothy Kelly of the McIntire School of Commerce as our faculty advisor. Our mission is to promote financial literacy both at UVA and in the wider Charlottesville community. At UVA, many undergraduate students lack basic personal finance skills necessary to live on their own. For example, too many 1st year students sign leases for 2nd year between September and October without fully understanding their rights or obligations under the expensive leases that local landlords make them sign. In addition, many sign up for credit cards and student loans, taking on debt for the first time, which leads to financial challenges early in their lives. It is our goal to promote financial literacy through guest speakers, lectures, and interactive activities. The need for financial literacy and personal finance basics is not only essential for UVA undergraduates, but extends to the local community. We want to help young people, minority groups and recent immigrants in the greater Charlottesville region similarly learn to better understand personal finance. This is why we are looking to partner with local high schools and Piedmont Virginia Community College to help promote financial literacy through presentations from Common Cents club members and to better prepare them for the financial decisions they will need to make in the near future. We hope to provide a great service opportunity for UVA students and help UVA make an impact on the local community through our mission.",

We pursue these goals not under the naïve impression that compromise on important questions of policy is always possible or even desirable.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between clinical care and human connection by fostering meaningful interactions between students and patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers.What sets CCI apart is our emphasis on holistic healing and personalized engagement. Unlike traditional volunteering groups that focus solely on logistical support, we create interactive, patient-centered experiences that uplift, engage, and empower. Our members develop and lead projects such as bedside art sessions, personalized poetry readings, musical performances, and letter-writing initiatives for hospital patients, elderly care residents, and individuals experiencing long-term illness. Creativity is the foundation for all of the projects we carry out. Additionally, we aim to provide students with an outlet for their creativity and opportunities to destress through mental health workshops, coloring book pages, stress ball making, etc. In doing so, not only do we empower the health and wellbeing of clinical spaces, but also in our own community. We have already launched several impactful projects, including our Handmade Card Initiative, where students crafted and donated heartfelt cards to the staff at the Emily Couric Clinical Cancer Center (ECCCC) as a gesture of appreciation for their dedication and hard work. We have also arranged an upcoming in-person delivery day, on February 20, 2025, during which ECCCC will provide an escort so that our members can personally distribute the cards to the healthcare staff, fostering direct and meaningful connections.Through interdisciplinary collaboration with artists, healthcare professionals, and community members, CCI offers a unique space where creativity meets care, fostering both artistic expression and compassionate service. Our initiative not only provides patients and healthcare workers with moments of joy and relief but also equips students with invaluable empathy, communication skills, and a deeper understanding of patient well-being beyond clinical treatment.CCI seeks to cultivate a culture of compassionate creativity, empowering students to use their artistic talents to make a tangible difference in the lives of those facing health challenges.",

However, it administers the interdisciplinary M.A. and M.B.A./M.A. degree programs in East Asian Studies, while the B.A. program in East Asian Studies is administered by the Department of East Asian Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. The Center encourages and coordinates East and Southeast Asia-related activities such as lectures, and supports faculty initiatives in publications, workshops, and conferences that involve faculty across departments. It also administers a grant program for student and faculty travel to East Asia. Since 2015, the generosity of the family of Bruce and Sally Nelson has allowed the Center to sponsor the “Nelson Lectures on Southeast Asia” and to offer travel grants to Southeast Asia for study and research.",

We aim to holistically support the generation of students that are first in their family to be exposed to the complexities of higher education through maximizing their knowledge and application of skills that are imperative to multi-dimensional career success. Through a bottom-up approach, we will guide students through the ins and outs of finding, earning, and multiplying opportunities geared toward the career path of their choosing as well as encouraging exploration of the disparities within that field, thereby making them eager to suture some gap. Using a vertical mentorship system, each student will have a mentor who will guide them to acquiring and applying skills necessary to excel at a large institution (including but not limited to networking, discovering low-cost resources, improving study methods, and general success strategies). Further, we understand the difficult transition into college, and we hope for all members to find a community of support within us. Through our diverse, open, and positively constructive environment, we aim to push each other in the direction of success.",

Her idea created an intellectual community here at UVA, where students from diverse backgrounds connected with professors of equally diverse fields in an intimate setting, ranging from a small classroom to Lawn Pavilions and Carr’s Hill. Now, we are reimagined as just Flash! This means that we won’t just aim to do seminars, we hope to expand to include other forms of creative learning, such as Flash Yoga on the Lawn, Flash Art Exhibits where we display student artworks in a pop-up space on Grounds, and even Flash Music where we can work groups like Bluegrass to have a pop-up space where there can be forum for hearing and learning music from and with your peers. For Flash Seminars and other variations, the time, place, and location is always different, offering a sense of newness within the program to encourage students to feel excited for the launch of new seminars. The mission of Flash is to meet students who also hold a love for intellectual curiosity. There are not many spaces at UVA where we can meet people from completely different backgrounds or fields of study anymore. By expanding to becoming just Flash, we will directly help with President Ryan’s 2030 Plan by doing exactly what it hopes for in one of its micro goals: “The best learning experiences—whether inside or outside of the classroom, on Grounds or off—create a sense of discovery.”",

Our events include guest speaker panels, film screenings, donation drives, social media campaigns, and collaborative programming focused on both raising awareness and inspiring action. Friends of MSF at UVA works closely with the UVA Center for Global Health Equity, which supports student initiatives related to global health, research, and outreach. We also regularly collaborate with other student organizations on Grounds, including Partners in Health Engage at UVA, to foster cross-campus dialogue around social justice and health equity. Additionally, we partner with external nonprofit organizations such as DKMS, which focuses on bone marrow donation awareness and registration, to provide students with hands-on ways to contribute to lifesaving causes. Through our programming and partnerships, we aim to create a vibrant and inclusive space for students interested in global health, medical humanitarianism, and social justice.

Our objective is to provide a platform where students can learn the art of long-term investing while gaining practical experience through managing a real investment fund.By joining the GFSIF, students have the opportunity to develop valuable skills that will serve them throughout their lives. Through our monthly lectures, workshops, and pitch competitions, members will gain in-depth knowledge of investment strategies, stock selection, and portfolio management. They will have the chance to learn directly from industry veterans, such as Tom Gayner, CEO of Markel, and other prominent guest speakers who will share their expertise and insights. Each year's fund is held uninterrupted for 25 years. After that, the fund is liquidated, with half of the proceeds going into the next available fund and the other half directly funding scholarships for UVA students. Our hope is that through our work, one day every student who attends UVA will have an education fully funded through this investment club.Members will gain a solid foundation in long-term investing, a investment approach the first of its kind among the funds at UVA . This knowledge will be applicable not only to their personal finances but also to potential careers in finance, asset management, or entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the GFSIF offers every member a chance to actively manage a real investment fund and contribute to scholarships for future UVA students. This hands-on experience is invaluable, as it allows members to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, enhancing their understanding of financial markets, while building a brighter future for our university.",

Recently, we have hosted panels with infectious disease experts to broaden the conversation about the interdisciplinary nature of disease. Additionally, we have hosted research poster sessions where students have an opportunity to meet graduate students and faculty who run research, and talk to them first hand about what they’re studying, and how to get involved.",

Several schools in low-income communities do not have the funding nor the resources to provide health education for children, resulting in an increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity. Through a volunteer-run, structured after-school program at elementary schools in Charlottesville and the Boys and Girls Club of Central Virginia, we aim to offer exciting and informative nutrition and physical activity sessions for children, as well as provide parents with information to help maintain healthy habits in their children and themselves. Some examples of nutrition lessons we teach are food groups, how to read and understand nutrition labels, and how to prepare healthy snacks. Moreover, we target our lessons to incorporate both mental and physical health guidance. We hope to defeat childhood obesity in America and build lifelong healthy habits in elementary students, one school at a time. ",

The current president founded an online platform to help both herself and other students to express their anxieties and pressure through this anonymous platform. She made a Google Form to collect students’ responses and post them on Wechat every week. Soon it became popular among certain student groups and some students came together to found this organization as it is now. Weekly Wechat push has become a regular event for our organization. After the organization was created, our organization also sought for other ways that engage Chinese students to share their daily life and facilitate a sense of belonging at UVA. For instance, some students would make cooking tutorials videos for us. Pets videos are popular in our Wechat push as well. In order to provide those who are interested in pets more information about keeping a pet, we make videos of the pets from Chinese students. These videos are all distributed online via the Wechat. Apart from video-featured columns, our organization decided to initiate discussions of common social issues among students to help relieve stresses and enlighten them. The topics of discussions we have initiated include depression and eating disorder. By collecting and posting anonymous response from students who have experienced similar issues, we tried to let other people be more aware of the issue and keep an eye on themselves and people around them.

    "description": "The Human Flourishing Project at UVA is a student-led movement that fosters personal excellence and collaborative belonging through structured mentorship and reflection rooted in cultivating virtues necessary to thrive as a college student. Our organization aims to create a self-sustaining culture where students systematically extend their conceptions of what is possible for themselves and others. This is done by having upperclassmen serve as mentors to primarily underclassmen. They provide structured guidance to their mentees' journey towards academic, professional, and personal flourishing. Upon year-long participation, mentees are trained and then transition into mentors, ensuring a continuous cycle of leadership and growth.Every two weeks, a topic focused on in one of the targeted buckets (Professional, Personal, Academic) is discussed. A quick rundown includes, but is not limited to: Professional topics include networking/social Intelligence, work ethic, and understanding what career is best for our goals/values, as well as the steps to take to achieve these goals. Personal topics include resiliency, finding purpose/meaning, and fostering altruism/reflecting on what we want to fight for (will consist of collective volunteering/community service projects). Academic topics include self-discipline (concentration and focus), time management, and motivation. However, topics will usually be based on what the collective wants to tackle, so a group survey will be conducted at the beginning. After this, a mentee is paired with a mentor based on shared goals, interests, and aspirations to be most closely aligned with who they want to become. These topics will be discussed as a group during the bimonthly meetings. The mentor will more systematically develop them through very brief 30-45 minute weekly homework with occasional check-ins. Through further refinement, sponsored college-wide workshops and speaker events featuring renowned psychologists/philosophers will be held. Then, towards the end, there will be a collective reflection on the collective growth that has been accumulated. ",

    "name": "Hypersonic ReEntry Deployable Glider Experiment at UVA",
    "description": "The Hypersonic ReEntry Deployable Glider Experiment (HEDGE) is an exciting student-led engineering project that began as a capstone project at the University of Virginia. Our goal is to break down the high-cost barriers typically associated with hypersonic research by designing and launching an innovative, low-cost experiment. Using a CubeSAT framework, we’re proving that impactful aerospace research doesn’t need multi-million-dollar budgets.Scheduled to launch in August 2025 this year and in future years through NASA’s RockSat-X program at Wallops Flight Facility, HEDGE is more than a technical experiment—it’s a once-in-a-lifetime educational experience for undergraduate aerospace engineering students. Together, we’ve developed a system that will collect crucial real-time data on hypersonic reentry dynamics, using a modular design that can serve as a model for affordable research by academic and small-scale institutions.One of HEDGE’s biggest innovations is its ability to connect to the Iridium Constellation Satellite mid-flight to transmit real-time data to a ground station at UVA. This live telemetry will provide insights into temperature, pressure, position, and aerodynamic performance, allowing us to evaluate the experiment’s success in real-time. Additionally, we’ve equipped the rocket with a camera to record the deployment of the glider. This video will let us verify if we’ve overcome a major challenge faced by past HEDGE teams: the successful deployment of aerodynamic fins. These two features—live data transmission and real-time footage—give our team the tools to achieve breakthroughs where others have struggled.But HEDGE isn’t just about technical success—it’s also about empowering students. Our team is learning through hands-on experience, using industry-standard tools like MATLAB, SolidWorks, and Ansys, and tackling real-world challenges in aerospace design and testing. This project simulates what it’s like to work in the aerospace industry, providing invaluable lessons in collaboration, problem-solving, and communication. Students are also guided by faculty mentors and industry professionals, gaining connections and insights that will help launch their careers.HEDGE is supported by UVA’s Department of Engineering, which provides credibility, resources, and opportunities to share our story. In fact, one of the most exciting parts of this journey is the potential for outreach: we plan to share our progress through articles and publications, raising awareness about the possibilities of low-cost hypersonic research and inspiring others to follow in our footsteps. This exposure not only highlights the groundbreaking work of our team but also shows how projects like this can prepare students to make meaningful contributions to the aerospace field.At its core, HEDGE is about making hypersonic research more accessible. By using a CubeSAT platform and innovative design strategies, we’ve created an experiment that can collect high-value data during reentry—at speeds of up to Mach 4.88—without the massive price tag. This modular, scalable approach can open doors for other universities and organizations to explore hypersonic research, breaking down barriers and democratizing access to this critical area of aerospace innovation. HEDGE is a not only unique project focused not only on a low-cost CubeSAT launch, but an investment in the next generation of aerospace professionals. Backed by UVA’s Department of Engineering and connected to NASA’s RockSat-X program, HEDGE offers a unique opportunity to make an impact on both education and research. Together, we can inspire change, create opportunities, and take an important step toward making hypersonic research more accessible for everyone.",

We conduct regular research workshops, providing practical guidance on legal research methodologies, including effectively using various legal databases, understanding legal citations, and enhancing proficiency in legal writing and comprehensive research strategies. We also invite distinguished legal scholars and researchers to share their insights on current legal issues and our guidance on research practices, enriching the intellectual exchange among our members.The presence of the Legal Research Forum within a university setting is crucial due to its role in fostering a culture of in-depth research and enhancing academia. The organization catalyzes students to delve deeper into their areas of interest, question existing knowledge and theories, and contribute novel insights and perspectives to the broader legal discourse. By offering guidance in research methodologies and providing practical support, the Forum enables students to navigate the complex landscape of legal research effectively. It also creates opportunities for cross-disciplinary interaction, allowing students to learn from diverse fields, enriching their research projects, and broadening their intellectual horizons. The presence of such an organization in a university also helps bridge the gap between various academic programs, fostering a cohesive intellectual community. This environment of educational enrichment, facilitated by the Legal Research Forum, is vital for nurturing well-rounded, critically thinking legal professionals who can contribute meaningfully to the legal field and society at large. It ensures that the university is not just a place for learning existing knowledge but also a hub for creating new knowledge.Although this organization has members who are University of Virginia students and may have University employees associated or engaged in its activities and affairs, the organization is not a part of or an agency of the University.

We work to make a difference in these children’s lives, spread awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma, and promote acceptance of facial diversity.Children with facial differences often endure the pain of teasing, bullying, and isolation— pain that can leave emotional scars that last a lifetime. Children that face the world with a difference also endure the challenge of a more silent, but just as damaging, form of stigma: that of unconscious bias. And so, many children with differences grow up in a world that tells them that their dreams must be smaller than those of their peers.Magical Moments is working to change all of that. We create magical experiences that restore hope and provide comfort, inspiration, and encouragement to children with facial differences that are the result of genetic disorders, congenital anomalies, cancer treatment, severe trauma and burns. We help children understand that they are not at all limited by their appearance, but only by the size of their dreams! Through the magical moments that we create, we not only make a difference in children’s lives, but we also promote awareness of the lifelong harm caused by appearance-related stigma and create more widespread acceptance of facial diversity within our communities.With your help, we can grant wishes that teach children with facial differences to believe in themselves while teaching the world to see and celebrate the beauty in every child!",

The club is composed of women students at the University of Virginia who have experience or interest in computing science. We hold meetings on grounds at UVA to plan curriculum, and we visit the middle school for an hour each week to teach these lessons. Alongside the lessons, we aim to foster positive relationships with the girls and to be role models for them. Our mission is to inspire young girls to pursue futures in technology through mentorship and hands-on learning experiences. As our organization body is composed of women computer science students, we know from experience the struggles of studying in a male-dominated field. By creating valuable and fun learning experiences, we hope to show them that it is worth it to pursue their interests, no matter the obstacles they come across. Additionally, other engineering and technical subjects will be introduced to the middle schoolers through projects and endeavors, such as Lego Education and guest speakers from female professors at UVA. Those interested in the club but who are not able to attend the Tuesday teaching sessions at the Village School are still encouraged to join MGIC. There are many opportunities to become involved outside of the sessions with the girls, such as curriculum creation and event planning.",

From the beginning, the desires to promote inclusivity and explore Filipino American identity were driving factors of the group. OYFA prioritizes welcoming and compassionate community-building by adapting to and addressing the various needs of their members. While OYFA acts to heighten appreciation for Filipino culture, its values have attracted a diverse group of students. OYFA’s organizational structure comprises an Executive Board and an Executive Council that holds 12 different committees with distinct purposes, including representatives for the Filipino Intercollegiate Networking Dialogue (FIND). In addition to its leadership structure, OYFA has a Forever Family system and alumni network that promotes strong personal connections throughout the entire organization. The organization holds various events and programs that provide a cultural, social, service, and academic network for the purpose of empowering their members and the Asian-American identity.&#34;Join the Organization of Young Filipino Americans!

We intend to platform a variety of backgrounds and belief systems, challenging the non-diversified nature of two-party ideological systems. Through this, we question the prevailing norms of media coverage that wilfully overlook the wide spectrum of political and social perspectives that embodies our Nation’s rich history. By bringing together two co-hosts who may have varying ideological standpoints, we cultivate a piquant, and, hopefully, humorous dialogue that both enlightens and challenges our audience – exhibiting the nuance within our generation’s worldviews and political leanings. Our programming is designed to be thought provoking and encourage our listeners, viewers, and fellow students to think critically about the narratives that shape our nation and our campus.    Our commitment to inclusivity is reflected in our rigorous approach to content creation. Each episode or clip is meticulously crafted behind the scenes. We hold a team of thorough researchers, knowledgeable production managers, eloquent co-hosts, quick-witted social media directors, and a personable communications chair. Each episode of Coup De Pod requires weeks of prepwork in the form of scheduled internal meetings, informed research and interviews, and meticulous editing before publication. Since the beginning of this project, each member has integrated their passion into their work, striving to build a more engaged and informed community through a recognition of the necessity of radical subjectivity. Each semester holds a new mission to expand our reach into other platforms. We soon hope to use Tiktok to showcase smaller clips of our team reaching out to individual students, recording takes big and small in order to broaden our reach and display the mindsets of those who are on Grounds. ",

The recreational team meets once a week to engage in casual, friendly competition with other members of the club. Recreational team members are also taught and guided throughout the learning experience by returning members and members of the competitive team. The competitive team meets at least once a week for mandatory team practices and travels to VT, JMU, Richmond, and Virginia Beach every year to participate in intercollegiate tournaments as part of the Collegiate Cues North East Tour. Players need to try-out in order to join the competitive team. The club normally meets at the 1515 on the corner, or occasionally at the Madhouse. ",

S4H focuses specifically on pediatric oncology patients, and works with partnering companies to provide children in various areas nationwide with the opportunity to custom paint a pair of Nike Air Force Ones. These shoes are then worn by the coaching staff, and other leadership during a game, with each coach or individual wearing a unique pair created by one of the participating children. After the game, the shoes are signed, returned to S4H, and donated to local health systems, which auction them off to raise funds for their pediatric oncology departments.In addition to the shoe painting, participating children are given tickets to a game, stadium tours, access to a basketball practice and halftime recognition during the aforementioned game. S4H aims to increase public awareness of pediatric cancer and provide children with the chance to express themselves creatively, while also bringing attention to an underfunded area of cancer research.",

The classes offer cardiovascular and strength training, and benefits include self-defense, confidence, focus, and fitness. Frequent repetition is required to progress in any study of martial arts, so students should try to attend two classes per week.",

Our brotherhood is a close-knit group brought together by the common values of Love, Honor, and Truth.We are a chapter active in all sectors of university life. As the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts, so too does the diversity of the Beta chapter provide the synergy for a house that continues to set the example for academic excellence, philanthropic service, campus leadership, and social engagement. Those who choose to pledge Sigma Nu do so to be their true selves and thrive in an environment that fosters personal growth and encourages individuality. The Beta chapter enhances the university experience of its members and builds a sense of community in a way that generates a desire to invest time, talent, and treasure in the development of both the organization and its future members.With over 65 active brothers, the Gentlemen of Sigma Nu at the University of Virginia make up one of the largest and most diverse fraternities on Grounds. Young men from all walks of life, from across the country and even overseas, call 189 Culbreth Road home. With brothers majoring in everything from Aerospace Engineering and Neuroscience to History and Foreign Affairs, the Beta chapter has maintained an average GPA above 3.5 - one of the highest among any large student organization at UVA. Our members are involved in a wide variety of academic, extracurricular, pre-professional, and athletic communities, with brothers serving as leaders in dozens of student groups. This focus on academic performance, alongside an embodiment of Sigma Nu’s values, also allows our members to excel in their career goals. Brothers have received internships or full-time offers at notable companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Accenture, Wells Fargo, KPMG, Jefferies, AQR Capital Management, Société Generale, Jump Trading, and more.In addition to an emphasis on academic performance, the Beta chapter strives to represent Greek Life across Grounds. Our active brothers are involved in over 40 student organizations at UVA, including the Jefferson Startup Network, Housing and Residence Life, Cavalier Daily, Student Council, McIntire Investment Institute, HackCville, Alexander Hamilton Society, Washington Literary Society, Global Markets Group, and Madison House.Our chapter takes pride in its community service and philanthropic endeavors as well. Every year, the brothers log over 1,600 individual volunteer hours through activities such as providing free tax preparation services to low-income families, packaging meals at the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, planting trees and promoting sustainable living, serving as teaching aides in local elementary schools, tutoring inmates as part of rehabilitation programs at the regional jail, teaching computer literacy to job-seekers at the Virginia Workforce Center, mentoring refugee children from Sierra Leone and Sudan, and engaging in recreational therapy for individuals with physical or mental disabilities. In addition to individual service, the Beta chapter of Sigma Nu strives to make an impact collectively, for example, by working with Habitat for Humanity to raise funds and awareness for affordable housing in Charlottesville. At the end of each Spring semester, the chapter also hosts a major outdoor philanthropy event, Xanadu, at which we consistently raise thousands of dollars for St. Jude Children’s Hospital.",

We host educational workshops, roundtable discussions, guest speaker series, hands-on events, and connect with students beyond UVA. Our flagship programs will include educational workshops on the ethical and societal implications of AI technology, as well as AI Safety fellowships that provide participants with fundamental knowledge of AI safety and relevant project experience, enabling them to engage meaningfully with the field. More specifically, through these events, we aim to 1) build a multidisciplinary community that discusses AI from humanistic and social perspectives, and foster proactive dialogues on AI risks and governance, and 2) function as a pipeline that helps UVA students, especially those with non-technical backgrounds, gain relevant knowledge and portfolios, enabling them to find internships, fellowships, and full-time jobs in AI safety and governance-related fields outside UVA.",

That’s why we’re rising up and organizing at UVA.Students Demand Action advocates for gun safety legislation locally and nationwide as well as proven community intervention solutions to gun violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. We focus on mitigating the causes and effects of all forms of gun violence that plague our country by organizing in communities to educate students, register voters, and demand common-sense solutions to this national public health crisis. We work to prevent gun violence because it is the leading cause of death for children and teens in the United States. Every day, more than 100 people are shot and killed and over 200 more are wounded. The daily toll of gun violence in our country doesn’t always make headlines, but this violence affects everyone, everywhere.After the tragedy we experienced in our community on November 13th, 2022, we realized enough is enough. We have restarted the University of Virginia's chapter of Students Demand Action and we are ready to fight for a cause that will not only better our community of Charlottesville, but save lives.1 | 15 | 41",

    "name": "TEDx UVA",
    "description": "Hey TedHeads! Thank you for your interest in TEDx at UVA!In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. These events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.TEDx at UVA put on its first event in April 2012 and has hosted a conference every year since. Our conference includes students, professors, and outside professionals as speakers. We host a mock conference in the fall where we give students the opportunity to present speeches and audition for the spot in our spring conference. Then in the spring, we host a professional conference of a carefully curated group of professional speakers who have been invited to share their stories and voices. Members of TEDx do not speak at our events, we are in different teams that work towards organizing our conference. Below are descriptions of each committee:Speakers Committee: Our Speakers committee works closely with our Curator to recruit our speakers and then continues to organize and oversee the progress of these selected speakers leading up to our TEDx conference. In the fall, members of this committee will work with the students who will have the opportunity to audition for a spot in our professional conference. Then in the spring, these members will be working closely with our selected professional speakers to ensure their confidence and success in the preparation for the conference. This involves team requires excellent editing and strong writing skills, writing and responding to emails efficiently, and providing advice to student speakers in a one-on-one mentoring setting. Members of the committee must be comfortable communicating in a professional and prompt manner and will be working in a very small group setting.PR/Sponsorship Committee: Our PR/Sponsorship Committee handles the fundraising and outreach to potential sponsors to support the events we put on. A majority of their workload is during the fall semester as they aim to gather the most financial support for our spring conference through at least one fundraising event, applying for grants, and managing relationships with corporate partners. In the spring, they connect with local media outlets and through other modes of PR, they push our mission of ideas worth spreading. This committee bridges the gap between our team and the University, as well as the larger community as well through the publication of a newsletter and other events. There are three positions who work under the committee chair(s): Outreach Coordinator, Communication Coordinator, and Newsletter Coordinator. The role is perfect for someone with an interest in finance, marketing, business, operations, and PR. Design Committee: Our Design committee is responsible for managing social media accounts, our website, and our on-Ground presence through flyering, chalking, and creating outreach videos. In addition, committee members will be creating graphics through various software programs for our socials and events, developing creative ideas for the team, and producing various marketing campaigns to be implemented on-Grounds for TEDx sponsored events. There are three positions who work under our committee chair(s): Graphic Designer, Newsletter Editor, and Social Media Coordinator. These members are required to work creatively, brainstorm new design approaches, and have experience in the realm of social media marketing. Logistics Committee: Our Logistics committee is concerned with the behind the scenes of the student speaker auditions in the fall, and perhaps more importantly, our professional conference in the spring, Being on this committee involves creating the decorations, designing the stage, and organizing venues—just to name a few. There are six positions which operate under the committee chair(s): Venue Liaison, Catering Coordinator, Speaker Experience, Logistics Liaison, Audience Experience Coordinator, and Stage Manager. Logistics members need to have a strong sense of timeliness, communication, and organizational skills in order to make the conferences run smoothly.Finance Committee: Our Finance committee is limited to three people, with a main treasurer who is then supported by two financial coordinators. This committee keeps our financial spendings and operations organized. The coordinators will support our treasurer in budget planning, tracking club expenses, and updating financial records as well as supporting our PR/Sponsorship committee with sponsorship and grant efforts. These members need to have strong organizational and record-keeping abilities. Please visit our website or instagram to learn more about TEDxUVA : https://www.tedxuva.org/ or https://www.instagram.com/tedxuva?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==",

Some residents are pursuing degrees in medicine or law; others are working on doctoral degrees in the arts and sciences.  As you walk past each room, you might encounter a historian, a physicist, a sociologist, and a biomedical scientist  - all living right next door to each other.However, the Range is more than just a place to live; it is also a community that encourages formal and informal contact between scholars in different disciplines and professions.  Most of the graduate students who live on the Range do so because it gives them the opportunity to meet people from other fields and to contribute to the University at large.

To this end, our organization reaches out to local hospitals and clinics, and accepts in-kind donations of medical goods. Medical equipment considered unusable by strict U.S. packaging and expiration regulations can still be effectively used abroad. Moreover, many medical organizations have no established program or protocol to donate surplus resources. Last academic year, we collected nearly $180,000 worth of medical supplies that otherwise would have been needlessly wasted and, with the help of our sister chapter at VCU, shipped the donations to Haiti. The long-term vision we have for this program isn’t just to manage a static set of supply chains. We intend to turn United2Heal into an umbrella organization providing medical supplies and financing to student-led humanitarian efforts. Future undergraduate students will have the opportunity to lead their own initiatives with our organization serving in a support role. Ultimately, the purpose of executive board members will be to secure medical supplies from local contacts, review student proposals of equipment use, and financing shipping to the destination country. Although this organization has members who are University of Virginia students and may have, University employees associated or engaged in its activities and affairs, the organization is not a part of or an agency. It is a separate and independent organization, which is responsible for and manages its own activities and affairs. The University does not direct, supervise or control the organization and is not responsible for the organization’s contracts, acts or omissions. ",

We are dedicated to providing UVA students interested in music production and band management with a platform to learn and have hands-on experiences. We delve into the rock/punk/pop band music through sessions that not only cover the fundamentals of band management, such as basic instrument setup, amplifier types needed, band promotion strategies, and performance preparation but also emphasize the importance of each instrument's role in music production. Our vision includes nurturing musical bands within the University of Virginia community to enhance the student body's appreciation for ensemble music as a form of collaborative art, by covering band music, and writing original songs. What we offerWe host sessions that dive deep into rock/punk band music. From band management to music production, our sessions intend to be informative and creative. In band management sessions, we cover the basic instrumental setup of bands, the types of amplifiers needed, ways to advertise one’s band, and what to prepare before a performance. We teach the basic skills required to become a professional band manager. In music production sessions, our core members will take turns giving mini-lectures on the instruments they are familiar with. Rather than teaching these instruments from scratch, the mini-lectures focus on the role of each instrument in band music production. Besides, we will go over how instruments work together to achieve various sound effects through the analysis of popular songs.Besides, members interested in performing will perform at community music events as a band throughout the year. Each year, we will produce about 5 original songs as an organization. The performing members will rehearse twice a month to prepare for two performances each semester. We welcome students interested in expanding their prior experience in instruments to music production in a band setting. We also welcome those who desire to learn how popular bands operate on the business side.  Future PlansOur vision for the club's future encompasses several ambitious objectives.Initially, our goal is to nurture the development of musical bands within the University of Virginia, aiming to broaden the student body's appreciation for the collaborative art of ensemble music. We advocate for the perception of a band as not merely a collective of instrumentalists but as a microcosm encapsulating a community, and indeed, a familial spirit. Participating in a band transcends the simple mastery of musical instruments; it involves cultivating profound interpersonal relationships among members, alongside acquiring the skills necessary for effective group management and motivation towards realizing a shared vision. Our interest extends beyond the music itself to encompass the dynamics of human interaction and the essence of band culture.Furthermore, we are committed to enhancing our contribution to the broader community through multifaceted initiatives. We recognize the transformative power of music and its capacity to serve as a force for societal benefit. Our overarching project aims to envision bands as entities capable of transcending musical performance, engaging in advocacy for marginalized societal groups, and leveraging their talents to foster joy and empowerment. We aspire to utilize our musical endeavors to support charitable causes, organize concerts dedicated to those in need, and ultimately, reinvest in our community with a spirit of generosity and compassion.",

    "name": "Virginia Journal of International Law",
    "description": "The Virginia Journal of International Law is one of the top ranked international law journals in the world. Founded in 1960, we are located at the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville, Virginia. We publish three times annually, and our issues contain Articles, Notes, and Essays. We also host an annual symposium.For an overview of who we are, where we've been, and our contributions to the field of international law, please read then-Dean Paul Mahoney's commemorative letter from the fiftieth anniversary Volume in 2010, copied below:&#34;We are all internationalists now. Fifty years ago, when the Virginia Journal of International Law began publication, international law was a narrowly-defined field concerned with the legal obligations of nation states vis-à-vis one another. International law scholars had relatively little to say to their domestic law counterparts and vice versa. Scholars of comparative law, although engaged in an analytically different exercise, shared much of the culture of international lawyers and published in the same journals, including VJIL. Today the barriers between international and domestic law are diminishing. In part, this is a simple result of the dramatic growth in cross-border movements of people and capital. But it is also, interestingly, a consequence of intellectual and cultural conflict between international and domestic law. Reflecting its origins, international law has a decidedly European sensibility. That sensibility is frequently out of step with American domestic law on matters relating to war, criminal punishment, the environment, and so on. It therefore matters whether international law limits or informs domestic law on those issues. In recent years, U.S. courts have partly opened the door to such influence. Barring a reversal of that trend or a substantial cultural shift on one side of the Atlantic or the other, the underlying policy conflicts will guarantee increasing debate between international and domestic law scholars. The era when each could ignore the other’s substantive commitments is over. A third reason for the convergence is methodological. International and comparative scholars were relative latecomers to the interdisciplinary movement in legal scholarship. More recently, international law scholars have come to rely on insights from international relations theory, which is in turn informed by game theory and institutional economics. The methodological distance between international law and domestic law scholarship, which widened with the creation of “law and” movements in the middle of the last century, has narrowed again. If international law scholars found political science and economics, we might say that economics found comparative law. In the past decade there has been an explosion of empirical work in macroeconomics that looks for the determinants of cross-country differences in the organization and operation of the economy. A striking conclusion of that literature is that the design of a country’s legal system is strongly related to the organization of its financial, product, and labor markets. This has sparked an outpouring of interest among economists in the differences among legal systems. Comparative law scholars have not been entirely welcoming of this interest, but here too it seems clear that the barriers separating comparative law and previously domestically-focused law and economics are breaking down. We can see the results in the pages of recent issues of VJIL, which discuss financial and environmental regulation, intellectual property, antitrust, and taxation, each only dimly on the minds of internationalists fifty years ago. This widening of the interests and concerns of international and comparative law is healthy and bodes well for the intellectual promise of VJIL’s next fifty years. VJIL has been a major forum for the development of scholarly ideas about international and comparative law over the past fifty years, and I congratulate the Journal and its editors, past and present, for their contribution to the advancement of those fields. I have no doubt that the future will be equally bright.&#34;",

The club is divided into three talent levels: Men and Women's Varsity, Club, and semester &#34;Bootcampers&#34;. Whether you have never picked up a mallet before, or been playing since you could walk, there is a place at Virginia Polo for you.Our Men and Women's Varsity teams compete at the highest level of the sport and have more National titles to their names than any other sport at UVA with 23 total. Both the Men's and Women's teams won their respective intercollegiate national titles in 2022. The Club team offers students with less experience a chance to play fun chukkers and develop their polo skills. Like Varsity, Club practices weekly and plays against other teams in the area.

    "description": "The Virginia Review of Politics, also known as “VROP” (pronounced vee-rop), is an undergraduate political magazine at the University of Virginia. The Review publishes wide-ranging content that aims at a middle ground between undergraduate academic journals and student newspaper opinion sections. We take a broad approach to the term politics – in addition to covering formal and electoral politics, our writers examine arts and literature, science and technology, social movements, public health, the environment, and a host of other topics. In doing so, we seek to prompt discussion among policy wonks and newcomers alike. The Review is an omni-partisan platform, which means that our pieces span a diverse array of intellectual and political backgrounds. By giving students an outlet for creative expression and experimentation, we hope to widen the scope of who is allowed to speak on contemporary affairs. We do not deny that our content is politically charged – in fact, that is one of our defining features. However, the articles we publish are meant to reflect only the opinions of their authors, and not the official stance of the Review. ",

Buckley Jr. in Sharon Connecticut and wrote its founding document titled, the “Sharon Statement.” Since then, YAF has been a leading figure in energizing young people around conservative leaders, such as Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, and helping college students battle liberal bias and indoctrination at their schools. While a YAF chapter was present at UVA throughout the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s the movement faded away and was not active until Anthony Hadford re-founded its presence in 2013.",
