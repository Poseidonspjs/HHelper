    "description": "This introductory course builds upon the histories of people of African descent in Africa, the Americas, and the Caribbean surveyed in AAS 1010. Drawing on disciplines such as Anthropology, History, Religious Studies, Political Science and Sociology, the course focuses on the period from the late 19th century to the present and is comparative in perspective. It examines the links and disjunctions between communities of African descent in the United States and in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. The course begins with an overview of AAS, its history, assumptions, boundaries, and topics of inquiry, and then proceeds to focus on a number of inter-related themes: patterns of cultural experience; community formation; comparative racial classification; language and society; family and kinship; religion; social and political movements; arts and aesthetics; and archaeology of the African Diaspora.",

This was later expanded to require that all fellows on NIH training grants should receive instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The requirement does not specify a particular format or curriculum. However, recommendations are made that several areas should be covered in the instruction: conflict of interest, responsible authorship, policies for handling misconduct, policies regarding the use of human and animal subjects, and data management. This course is designed to help student consider each of these areas and therein formulate an understanding of responsible conduct in research.",

The major goals of the course are to familiarize students with key research areas of importance for training as physician scientists, and to develop the student's presentation skills. Students are required to give a minimum of one oral presentation per year to their fellow students and to selected faculty members who have expertise in the area of presentation. Students also are required to attend presentations of other students and to participate in group discussions. In addition to research presentations by students, there will also be presentations by faculty members in areas of significance for training of physician scientists. Grading (S/U) will be based on the quality of the students' presentation, as well as the extent of their participation in group discussions.",

Students should gain an appreciation of the role of financial markets and institutions in our economy as well as an introduction to the responsibilities, concerns, and methods of analysis employed by corporate financial managers. We focus on the two fundamental aspects of financial decision-making: time value and risk (modern portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model, and alternatives). The concepts of time value and risk are used to value the two basic financial assets, bonds and stocks, as well as real assets, investment projects, and companies. In addition, the course introduces derivative securities (options, futures) and discusses their application in a wide variety of settings (real options, contingent claims valuation of equity). The course also covers the theory and practice of capital structure decisions (Modigliani and Miller, taxes, bankruptcy costs, asymmetric information, agency) and dividend decisions. The course will include a thorough discussion of market efficiency and an introduction to the field of behavioral finance. A unifying theme of the course is how no-arbitrage conditions and the law of one price can be used to value most financial assets. The emphasis in this course (both in and out of class) will be on problem solving. Prerequisite: COMM 3010, 3020, and 3030.",

Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think deeply about the nature of business, the responsibilities of management, and how business and ethics can be put together. Cases without easy answers that raise a range of problems facing managers in the contemporary business environment will be used. Discussions will focus on developing a framework for analyzing the issues in moral terms and then making a decision and developing a set of reasons for why the decision was justified. Students will be pushed to think carefully about how they make decisions and develop their capacity to defend their decisions to other stakeholders. This is important as a way not only to foster integrity and responsible decision making, but also to push students to take leadership roles in dealing with complex and difficult choices they will face in their careers. Operating from a managerial perspective, students will address a range of themes in the class, including basic concepts in ethics, responsibilities to stakeholders and the building blocks of markets, corporate culture, the sources of ethical breakdowns in organizations, managerial integrity, value creation, and personal values and managerial choice.",

Students will examine significant financial accounting and reporting issues from both a rigorous theoretical perspective and an informed practical perspective. Students will explore such traditional issues as revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and leases, and such contemporary issues as mergers and acquisitions, intangibles, and financial derivatives. Although the primary focus of the course will be on accounting and reporting practices in the United States, students will also address selected differences between U.S. accounting standards and international accounting standards. How the major accounting scandals that have occurred in recent years have affected the financial reporting process and those who have the responsibility for insuring the accuracy of a company's published financial statements will also be addressed. [l1] By the conclusion of this course, students should be reasonably proficient at understanding, interpreting, and analyzing the information contained in corporate financial statements and their related footnotes, and also be able to assess the overall quality of a company's financial reporting, identify the critical accounting policies, and make an assessment regarding the reasonableness of those policies and their supporting estimates and judgments.",

Students will examine how interest rates are impacted by such factors as central-bank behavior, fiscal policy, the state of the business cycle, productivity, inflation expectations, and international capital flows. For currencies, students will develop two related tool kits: one that is useful for understanding the drivers of orderly changes in exchange rates, and a second, through the construction of an early-warning system, that focuses on factors associated with large and potentially disorderly depreciations. Students will also investigate ways in which firms and investors manage interest-rate and currency exposure, as well as how countries manage exchange rates. The course, which includes both technical readings and cases, should appeal to a broad array of students, especially those who wish to pursue careers in investment banking, international finance, and general management.",

The course contains three modules: firm-valuation techniques, option-pricing principles, and fixed-income valuation. The first module extends the first-year finance course by considering more difficult firm valuations as well as alternate techniques for valuing firms. The second and third modules relate to the capital markets for which valuation principles from options and fixed-income instruments are used as building blocks to decompose the valuation of complex financial instruments.",

The course addresses critical well-researched joining-up phenomena such as letting go of the current engagement, establishing credibility, learning organizational norms, socialization, self-management, the locus of control, the effects of compromise, joining work groups and teams, adult-learning theory, orientation to hierarchy and power distance, managing upward, abrasive personalities, and consolidating experience-based learning. It is designed to capitalize on the literature and research bases provided by neurolinguistic programming, habitual behavior, and rational-emotive-behavior constructs in order to ensure that students will fit in quickly, gain influence rapidly, learn consistently, and outperform their competition. The provocative films encourage student engagement and, perhaps, life-changing debate.",

The other half will address a more tactical set of issues around engagement work-planning, data-gathering, field-interviewing, and communicating with clients.

The seminar meets in the Colonnade Club Pavilion on the Lawn at the University of Virginia, a setting that contributes to a means for Darden students to obtain a greater understanding of the culture and traditions of Mr. Jefferson's University. Reading selections are taken from the six-volume biography on Thomas Jefferson written by Dumas Malone, the book Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose, the book Founding Brothers by Joseph Ellis, the book John Adams by David McCullough, and the two prize-winning films on Jefferson by Ken Burns. The seminar participants include students and faculty from the Darden School along with interested University of Virginia alumni.",

How, for example, do you evaluate talent analytically, and decide how to construct, motivate, and compensate members of a team? While we can't know with certainty how a professional player (i.e., employee) will perform in the future, models can be built to analyze the past, thus make powerful statistical predictions.",

    "description": "Situations requiring action vary in complexity and scope. The decision settings include a rich variety of dilemmas general managers inevitably face. This course focuses on general managers and the requirement that they take action in situations, which vary in complexity and scope. General Managers are defined as those managers who possess profit and loss responsibility at any level of the organization from first-level product-line managers to chief executive officers. General Managers must also manage the interfaces of the functional departments: marketing, operations, finance, and engineering or R&D. The goal in each class is for students to develop a plan of action and to think through the detailed steps, which would be needed to implement their plans. Students should be prepared to use current management tools, tried and true management philosophies, and all of the multidisciplinary tools they have internalized in their MBA education when deciding how to take action. The course requires students to capitalize on their entire Darden experience and polish their enterprise perspective. Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.",

Course content will involve preparation at the beginning of the summer when students will plan a program of readings and discussions supervised by a faculty member and make a personal statement of the learning expectations they have for this summer activity, a midsummer report about what they are experiencing. At the end of the summer, students will engage in a class discussion based on each student's in-class report about a significant and surprising aspect of their cultural experience and what was learned from it. Students also will be expected to write a final report reviewing their cultural experience and the extent to which their learning expectations were achieved. The report should also compare and contrast their job experience with what they might have experienced in their country of permanent residence. Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.",

The scenes will be chosen for their relevance to both leadership and ethics. The course is built around the conceptual apparatus in Dunham and Freeman (2000) that the task of the theatre director is akin to the task of the CEO. For example, students will examine how directors draw vision from particulars, emphasize good casting or 'getting the right people on the bus,' get the best out of their team, and approach work collaboratively. The class will examine theater companies as high-performance teams and attempt to construct such teams throughout the course. The course draws on the expertise of the artistic community in Charlottesville by providing several technical workshops on acting and directing. Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students.",
