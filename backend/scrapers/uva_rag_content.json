    "content": "Essential Academic Advice from UVA Students (from Reddit and student experiences):\n\n1. ACTUALLY GO TO CLASS\nYou're never going to watch recordings later. Professors notice attendance and it affects participation. Being present helps you learn better. You're paying a lot of money to be here - use it.\n\n2. Get to Know Your Professors\nIntroduce yourself during the first week. Attend office hours early in the semester (not just before exams). Professors give grace on extensions when they know you. They're full of wisdom outside the classroom. This leads to research opportunities and strong recommendation letters.\n\n3. Don't Compare Yourself to Others\nThere will always be people who seem smarter or better. Focus on doing your personal best. Your mental health matters more than perfect grades. GPA matters less than you think (unless pre-med or law school).\n\n4. Use Your Resources\n- Writing Center: free consultations for any writing project\n- Teaching Resource Center: peer tutoring for most intro courses  \n- Office hours: professors actually want to help you\n- Academic coaching: time management and study strategies\n- CS TAs: incredibly helpful for debugging and concepts\n\n5. Course Planning Tips\n- Read Lou's List AND Course Forum before registering\n- Talk to upperclassmen about specific professors\n- Balance hard classes with enjoyable ones each semester\n- Leave room in schedule for unexpected opportunities\n- Don't take all your hardest classes in one semester\n\n6. Time Management\n- Set boundaries before classes start (e.g., no work after 10pm)\n- Don't sacrifice sleep, meals, or mental health for grades\n- Find YOUR study routine (everyone is different)\n- Use syllabi to plan ahead for busy weeks\n- Start assignments early to avoid all-nighters\n\n7. CS-Specific Advice\n- CS 2100 is a make-or-break course - take it seriously\n- CS 2120 is required for almost everything - don't delay\n- Don't take CS 2100, 2120, and 2130 all together\n- Join CSS and go to office hours religiously\n- Start coding assignments the day they're released\n- Test your code thoroughly before submitting",
